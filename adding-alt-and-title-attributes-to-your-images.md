# Lesson 3.2 Adding alt and title Lesson 3.2: Attributes to your Images

The alt attribute is absolutely necessary! Its function is to describe the content of your images to visually impaired persons who use a screen reader and also allows search engines to index the content of your images. Its form is **alt=”short\_description\_of\_image”**.

1. Add the alt attribute to both of the images in your page.
2. The title attribute adds a tooltip to an image that pops up text when the mouse passes over the image. Its form is **title=”some\_text\_describing\_the\_image”**. Do not confuse this **attribute-value** use of the word, title, with the html tag of the same name!
3. Add a tooltip to one of the images in your page.

## Code Example

```text
<img src="images/face.jpeg" width="400" alt="Snow leopard face" title="Snow Leopard Face"/>
```
