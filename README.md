# Introduction

I have taught an exploratory class in web development to 12-13 year old middle school students for the past six years. In this time, I have found that integrating a project-based learning approach into my teaching of coding/computer science generates more student motivation and enthusiasm. My students create and eventually collaborate on topics of their own choice, building projects of increasing scope and complexity using the client-side web languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I model, in a simplified environment, the process of creating authentic projects that the students follow using their own authored content. As they gradually recognize common patterns and workflows, they acquire skills that lead to independence in building their own websites. I have taught this course using Chromebooks, laptops, and desktop computers. The students currently use the free online editor, Repl.it, for creating their projects.

## How to Set Up Classrooms on the Repl.it Website

Sign up for an account on the Repl.it homepage. Select Teacher for your role during this process. When logged in to Repl.it, select Teacher from the drop-down box in the upper left and you will be taken to the Repl.it Classroom page. Select **Create a Classroom**, give it a name, and choose **HTML, CSS, JS** as the language. In the flyout menu, you will find a Share link that contains the URL your students can use to join your classroom.

Selecting your Classroom allows you to create a project template for your students. Projects allow students to both create folders to store images and scripts and allow them to host finished projects. When the students open the project you have assigned, it forks your project and creates a linked repl.it that you can view.
