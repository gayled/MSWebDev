# Introduction

As a five-year teacher of web development to 12-13 year olds, I have observed that integrating a project-based learning approach into my teaching of coding/computer science elicits more student motivation and enthusiasm. Students create and eventually collaborate on topics of their own choice building projects of increasing scope and complexity utilizing the client-side web languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My intent is to model, in a simplified environment, the process of creating authentic projects using web technologies, that the students imitate using their own created content. Through recognition of common patterns and workflows, they gradually build skills that lead to independence in project creation.  Google Drive and apps available through it are all that is necessary for this course, which I have taught using Chromebooks, laptops, and desktop computers.

# How to Set Up the Student Folders on Google Drive

Create a folder for the course and create a folder for each student within it. I use last names for the student folders. Share each student folder, giving the student access to add, organize, and edit content in the folder. Create a folder within each student folder, naming it **websites**. This folder should be given the access of "Anyone on the Internet can find and view" \(located by clicking on the Advanced link. This is all the class setup that is necessary.
