# Introduction

As a five-year teacher of web development to 12-13 year olds, I believe that integrating a project-based learning approach into my teaching of coding/computer science generates more student motivation and enthusiasm. My students create and eventually collaborate on topics of their own choice building projects of increasing scope and complexity using the client-side web languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I model, in a simplified environment, the process of creating authentic projects that the students follow using their own created content. As they gradually recognize common patterns and workflows, they acquire skills that lead to independence in building complete websites .  Google Drive and the apps available through it are all that is necessary for this course, which I have taught using Chromebooks, laptops, and desktop computers.

# How to Set Up the Student Folders on Google Drive

Create a folder for the course and create a folder for each student within it. I use last names for the student folders. Share each student folder, giving the student access to add, organize, and edit content in the folder. Create a folder within each student folder, naming it **websites**. This folder should be given the access of "**Anyone on the Internet can find and view**" \(located by clicking on the Advanced link. This is all the class setup that is necessary.
