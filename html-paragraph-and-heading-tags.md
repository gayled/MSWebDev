## Lesson1:2  HTML Paragraph and Heading Tags

Pick a topic for a simple 2-page website. Create a heading and 2 paragraphs of approximately 50 words each in the code editor \(on the left in the Editey IDE\).

1. View your results in the preview pane \(right\) by selecting the icon that looks like a counterclockwise arrow. You will see that there is no structure to your web page.

2. Place paragraph tags \(**&lt;p&gt;** and **&lt;/p&gt;\)** around the first paragraph and view the results. Do the same for the second paragraph.

3. Enclose the heading in h1 tags \(**&lt;h1&gt; **and **&lt;/h1&gt;**\).

4. Experiment with enclosing the heading between h2,  h3,  h4,  h5, and h6 tags. Then set it back to h1 tags.

5. Use **h2** tags to give each paragraph a sub-heading.

**Notes:** You have started to mark up your page with HTML tags. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. This is a web language that uses special tags to give structure to webpages. These tags have special **syntax \(**or grammar rules\) that you must follow. If you forget to put a closing tag on your heading, for example; you have made a syntax error and your website will not display correctly.

HTML tags have special meanings, too. Even if you think the h1 tags make your main heading display too large and you like the size of the of the h2 heading better; you should not substitute it because there are other ways of adjusting font size. A page has only one main heading and h1 is used to denote that. This is an example of the importance of **semantics**, which is the meaning that tags give to the structure of your web page. Correct semantics is important for the nonhuman viewers of your web page too, such as the browser rendering engine and search engines.
