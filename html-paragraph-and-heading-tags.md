# Lesson 1.2: HTML Paragraph and Heading Tags

Pick a topic that you know a lot about for your first 2-page website. Select index.html from the files in the left pane of the Repl.it editor. Create a heading and 2 paragraphs of approximately 50 words each in the code editor \(the center pane\).

1. View your results in the preview pane \(right pane\) by selecting the Run button. You will see that there is no structure to your web page.
2. Place paragraph tags \(**&lt;p&gt;** and **&lt;/p&gt;\)** around the first paragraph and view the results. Do the same for the second paragraph.
3. Enclose the heading in h1 tags \(**&lt;h1&gt;** and **&lt;/h1&gt;**\).
4. Experiment with enclosing the heading between h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 tags. Then set it back to h1 tags.
5. Use **h2** tags to give each paragraph a sub-heading.

**Notes:** You have started to mark up your web page with HTML tags. HTML is an abbreviation for hypertext markup language. This is a web language that uses special tags to give structure to web pages. These tags have special **syntax \(**or grammar rules\) that you must follow. If you forget to put a closing tag on your heading, for example; you have made a syntax error and your website will not display correctly.

HTML tags have special meanings, too. Even if you think the h1 tags make your main heading display too large and you like the size of the of the h2 heading better; you should not substitute it because there are other ways of adjusting font size. Your page has only one main heading and h1 is used to denote that. This is an example of the importance of **semantics**, which is the meaning that tags give to the structure of your web page. Correct semantics are important for the nonhuman viewers of your web page too, such as the browser rendering engine and search engines.

## Code Example

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;Snow Leopards&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Introducing the Snow Leopard&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a snow leopard? They are some of the most beautiful animals on   Earth. They have a whitish-gray fur coat spotted with large black spots that allows them to blend in with the rocky mountains where they live. Snow leopards have also adapted to live in some of the most severe climates on Earth? You would think that they would be tough survivors but you would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;How the Snow Leopard Adapts to its Environment&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, these large cats have been the kings of the mountains of central Asia. They can jump six times the length of their body and can use their large tails for balance. They can also wrap their tails around their body for an extra fur coat when it is extremely cold. So why are they endangered?&lt;/p&gt;
