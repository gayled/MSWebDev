## Lesson1.1: **Creating a Folder for Your Website on Google Drive**

1. In your Shared with Me folder you will find a folder with your last name.
2. Move this folder into My Drive. Inside this is another folder named websites. This is where you will create all websites that you will make in this course.
3. Search for the following apps in Chrome Web Store: **Editey**, **HTML Editey**, **CSS Editey**, and **JavaScript Editey**. All four of these must be attached to your drive in order to edit websites using the Editey integrated development environment \(IDE\).
4. Choose a topic for a simple 2-page website. Within your websites folder create a new folder with the name of your topic.
5. Right-click on this folder and choose ‘**Open with Editey**’. Choose '**create a new workspace'**; you don’t have to name it.
6. Choose Cancel when you are asked to add files to the workspace.

When the editor has opened, select new HTML file from the file menu and name it **index.html**.

**Notes:** Use short, one word names for all your folder and file names. It is also a good idea to use all lowercase letters. You will make many fewer errors if you don't have to remember long file/folder names with spaces or uppercase letters when you refer to them in your code.

You will not lose any work if you delete an Editey workspace. Only if you delete files or folders will you have a problem and they can always be recovered from your Trash.
