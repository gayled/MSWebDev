# Lesson 1.1 Getting Started with the Repl.it Editor

Sign up for an account on the Repl.it homepage. Select Student for your role. Use the shared link your teacher provides to enroll in the Repl.it classroom for this course. In your profile you will see a notification for your first project.

When you select this project, it will contain three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. The last file won't be needed for this project. The index.html template created by your teacher contains 1 line: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.

The Repl.it editor has three panes. The left pane contains the files you will be creating and editing for your website. The center pane is the editor where you will be writing the code that the browser interprets as your website. When you select "Run", the right pane renders your coded website in the browser. The small arrow button in the right corner opens a tab to your website hosted on Repl.it.
