# Unit 1: Creating a Basic Website

This unit consists of 6 lessons that demonstrate how to set up a workflow on Repl.it and create a 2 page website using HTML and CSS. Students learn the basic HTML tags \(syntax\) as well as how to add meaningful structure \(semantics\) to the content of their web pages. They learn the basic CSS rules for the presentation of their websites using their distinctive stylings.

The Repl.it  editor \(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\) used in this course is very minimal, with basic syntax highlighting and formatting, but it does support live preview. Repl.it is extremely powerful when used in teaching, allowing file sharing, collaboration in Multiplayer mode, and website hosting.
