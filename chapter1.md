# Unit 1: Creating a Basic Website

This unit consists of 6 lessons that demonstrate how to set up a workflow on Google Drive and to create a 2 page website  using HTML and CSS. Students learn the basic HTML tags \(syntax\) as well as how to add meaningful structure \(semantics\) to the content of their web pages. They learn the  basic CSS rules for the presentation of their websites using their distinctive stylings.

Google Drive does not function as a web server. It can serve as a simple model of how websites are structured on the server, but lacks the means to specify certain features such as absolute paths or child-to-parent file traversal. It serves files statically; therefore only client-side scripting is available.

The Editey  editors \(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\) used in this course are very minimal, with basic syntax highlighting and formatting, and can be used in an Editey IDE which does support multi-file views, auto-save, and live preview. Editey is extremely powerful when used in teaching because it has fully incorporated Google Doc features including its look and feel, and allowing file sharing and instant collaboration.
