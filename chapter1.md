# Unit 1: Creating a Basic Website

This unit consists of 6 lessons that demonstrate how to set up a workflow on Repl.it and create a 2 page website using HTML and CSS. You will learn the basic HTML tags \(syntax\) as well as how to add meaningful structure \(semantics\) to the content of your web pages. You will learn the basic CSS rules for the presentation of your websites using your distinctive stylings.

The Repl.it editor \(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\) used in this course is very minimal, with basic syntax highlighting and formatting, but it does support live preview  Repl.it is very versatile  allowing file sharing, collaboration in multiplayer mode, and website hosting.
