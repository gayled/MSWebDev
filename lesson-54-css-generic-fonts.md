## **CSS Generic Fonts**

Generic fonts can be displayed in any web browser without any problems. CSS has five of these font types: They are **cursive** and **fantasy**, which are good for headings; **monospace **is usually used for displaying code; **serif **has little hooks on the end of its letters and is good for printed text and headings; **sans-serif **has no hooks and is mainly used for text as it is easier to read. Serif is the default browser font.

1. Change the font of the website to sans-serif using the property, **font-family**.

2. Change your headings to a cursive, fantasy, or sans-serif font using the property font-family.

Example:

**html {**

   **font-family: sans-serif;**

**}**

**h1 {**

   **font-family: cursive;**

**}**

**h2, h3 {**

   **font-family: sans-serif;**

**}**
