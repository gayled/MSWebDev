## Lists and the Header, Footer, and Section Elements

In this series of lessons, we will start to organize our content into three main sections that are typically seen in web pages. As you create your second page think of two sets of information that you can make into lists. For example, in a web page that I created about snow leopards, I included a list of countries where snow leopards are found and a list of factors that are causing their endangerment. In the first list you create, the order doesn't matter, but in the second list it does. In my example, the order of the countries doesn't matter,  but the causes of endangerment are in order of importance.
