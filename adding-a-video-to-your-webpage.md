## Adding a Video to Your Web Page.

1. Go to YouTube and find a video thatâ€™s appropriate for your website. Since you are NOT making a video-streaming site like NetFlix, I suggest finding a video that is under 5 minutes in length. When you find a video to add to your webpage, select **Share** at the bottom of the video frame. Then select **Embed** and copy the code with the **&lt;iframe&gt;** tags that will allow you to view the video from within your webpage. 

**Note:**

You will notice that all your html elements \(paragraphs, headings, video, etc.\) stack up like blocks on your web page. Except for the images, which are inline-block elements, these elements are **block elements **which means they display in invisible rectangles in the browser and stack one on top of each other like blocks. You will use CSS later to adjust the layout of these elements. For now, we are concerned with building up the structure of your page with HTML.
