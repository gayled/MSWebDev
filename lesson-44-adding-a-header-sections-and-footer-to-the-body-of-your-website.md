# Lesson 4.4: Adding a Header, Section\(s\), and Footer to the Body of Your Website

1. Most websites are organized so that their logo and main site navigation are located at the top of each web page and use this same content and design on each page of the site. This is called the **header** area. Enclose your logo and site navigation \(**&lt;nav&gt;** and **&lt;/nav&gt;**\) within **&lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;** tags.
2. Most websites also have site-specific information \(Conditions of Use, Privacy Notice, copyright, etc\) with the same content and design located at the bottom of each page. This is called the **footer** area. Add footer tags **&lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;** and between them add **Created by First Name Last Initial**. Do not put your full name or those of your family and friends or any other information such as addresses or telephone numbers on any of your websites.
3. HTML **entities** are special characters such as copyright and trademark symbols that need special markup to display properly in websites. A collection of these characters and their codes can be found here:[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref)

Add a copyright symbol **Â©** between Created by and your First Name Last Initial.

The region of the web page body between the header and footer can be divided into one or more sections with **&lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;** tags. For this simple website we will use only one set of section elements.
