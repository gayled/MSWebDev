## **Adding Images to Your Web Page**

1. Add your first image between the 1st paragraph and the subheading for the second paragraph.

2. The tag for adding an image is **&lt;img src=”images/yourimagename.ext”&gt; **\(no closing tag for images\).

**Note: **The difference between an **href **and a **src** attribute is that href just refers to another resource that your web page links to and a src actually embeds the resource in your web page.

  3.  When you preview the web page you will probably find that the image is too big or too small for the page. You should adjust   the size by adding the attribute-value pair **width=”experiment\_with\_different\_sizes**”. The value should be a number with no units, such as width=”150”. Be sure to add a space between the src attribute value pair and the width attribute value pair.

  4.  Above your image, add an **h3** caption.

  5.  Repeat the same steps with your logo image. Add it before your h1 heading. Logos are generally small. Don’t add a caption.
