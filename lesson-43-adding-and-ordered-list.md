## **Adding an Ordered List**

When the order of your list matters, you want to use the ordered list element, &lt;ol&gt;.

1. Create another subheading and short paragraph to introduce the content of your ordered list.

2. Ordered lists use numbers as defaults. Ordered list elements are **&lt;ol&gt; **and **&lt;/ol&gt;**.

3. Nest the list items **&lt;li&gt; **and **&lt;/li&gt; **of your ordered list within your **&lt;ol&gt;** tags just as you did for your unordered list.

4. HTML uses **&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;** tags as a semantic element which adds emphasis to words or phrases. This replaces the deprecated \(not supposed to be used anymore\)  &lt;b&gt;  or bold tags. Enclose the part of your list items  that need emphasis with &lt;strong&gt; tags.

5. Add another image between the two lists.
