# Lesson 4.3 Adding and Ordered List

When the order of your list matters, you want to use the ordered list element, &lt;ol&gt;.

1. Create another subheading and short paragraph to introduce the content of your ordered list.
2. Ordered lists use numbers as defaults. Ordered list elements are **&lt;ol&gt;** and **&lt;/ol&gt;**.
3. Nest the list items **&lt;li&gt;** and **&lt;/li&gt;** of your ordered list within your **&lt;ol&gt;** tags just as you did for your unordered list.
4. HTML uses **&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;** tags as a semantic element which adds emphasis to words or phrases. This replaces the deprecated \(not supposed to be used anymore\) &lt;b&gt; or bold tags. Enclose the part of your list items that need emphasis with &lt;strong&gt; tags.
5. Add another image between the two lists.

`<h2>Causes of Snow Leopard Population Decline</h2>`

`<p>Many factors contribute to declining snow`

`leopard numbers in these countries. Some of them are:`

`</p>`

`<ol>`

`<li>Climate change - greatest long term threat that could destroy 30% of their habitat</li>`

`<li>Local communities - kill the animals snow leopards prey upon</li>`

`<li>Killed by farmers - when they prey on their livestock to survive</li>`

`<li>Human settlement in their range - forces them to survive in smaller areas with less prey</li>`
