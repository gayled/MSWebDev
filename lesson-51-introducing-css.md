# Lesson 5.1 Introducing CSS

CSS \(**Cascading Style Sheets**\) is the language that is used to define your website’s presentation or look and feel. It was developed so that the design and layout of a webpage could be separated from the content of the page.

The SS in CSS is an abbreviation for **stylesheet**, which is a set of design rules that tells the Web browser render engine how to display a web page. The C is an abbreviation for c**ascading** because, although the browser follows its own default stylesheet, stylesheets that you create can redefine and override the browser’s and other stylesheets that you include in your webpage \(even your own\) in the order that you include them.
