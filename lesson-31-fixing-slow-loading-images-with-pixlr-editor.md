# Lesson 3.1: Fixing Slow Loading Images with Pixlr Editor

Go to the Chrome Web Store and add the Pixlr Editor app to Chrome.

Images can load slowly even if they are being served from your images folder if the original image has a large size and/or a high resolution, both of which contribute to a large, slowly loading file. Pixlr Editor can fix these issues.

1. Right-click on the image and choose to open it with Pixlr Editor.
2. Choose image size under the image menu. Use the slider to adjust to a smaller size, making sure the constrain proportions checkbox is checked. Medium-sized images are in the 600 x 600 pixel range.
3. When you select Save from the File menu, you will be given an opportunity to adjust the quality down if necessary which further decreases the file size; but donâ€™t go below 30.

Optional:

Images can also be cropped to reduce file size. Choose crop from the image menu or use the crop tool and adjust the rectangle to enclose the part of the image you want to keep, then click outside the rectangle to generate the cropped image.
