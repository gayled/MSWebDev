## Lesson 2.1: **Adding an Images Folder to Your Website Folder1. 11.**

1. Within the folder for the website you’re building, add a new folder and name it **images**.

2. Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for the **Save to Google Drive** extension. Make sure it is the extension and not the app and select **Save to Chrome**.

You should see a small Google Drive icon in your toolbar.

1. You will add two images to your web page. One will be a logo for the top of your page and the other will be placed between the two paragraphs.

**Note: **It is not good to add too many images to web pages as you’re learning because they will cause your pages to load slowly. Also, we save all images to our images folder because, if images are linked directly to another website, they will break if the remote website moves or takes them down, leaving a gap in your page.

1. You can start your image search at **Creative Commons Search** which allows you to use these images in your website without restrictions. You can also search Google Images by selecting the tools and one of the usage rights that begins with **Labeled for**.....

2. Click on the image that you want and select the option, **View Image**. Make sure that the URL in the address bar ends in .**gif,** .**png**, or .**jpg**. Right-click on this image and choose **Save Image to Google Drive.** Do the same for your logo image.

3. Your images should be in the My Drive root folder. Move them into the images folder for your website.

4. Rename the images to an easy one-word name without capital letters, such as logo.png. Do not forget the 3 letter extension.
