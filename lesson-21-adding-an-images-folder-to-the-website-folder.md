# Lesson 2.1 Adding an Images Folder to the Website Folder

You will add two images to your web page. One will be a logo for the top of your page and the other will be placed between the two paragraphs. The img element is an inline element. Unlike block elements, such as paragraphs and headings, an image will take up only enough width as necessary. Two images will display side by side if their widths allow it.

**Note:** It is not good to add too many images to web pages as youâ€™re learning because they will cause your pages to load slowly. Also, we save all images to our images folder because, if images are linked directly to another website, they will break if the remote website moves or takes them down, leaving a gap in your page.

1. Select the folder icon in the upper left of the file pane of Repl.it and add a new folder named **images**.
2. You can start your image search at **Creative Commons Search** which allows you to use these images in your website without restrictions. You can also search Google Images by selecting the tools and one of the usage rights that begins with **Labeled for**....
3. Click on the image that you want and select the option, **View Image**. Make sure that the URL in the address bar ends in .**gif,** .**png**, or .**jpg**. Save the image.Do the same for your logo image.
4. Copy the image files into your Repl.it Images folder.
5. Rename each image to an easy one-word name without capital letters, such as logo.png. Do not forget the 3 letter extension.
