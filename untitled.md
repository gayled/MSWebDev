# Lesson 6.1 The Box Model

The browser by default displays block elements in new lines from top to bottom and inline elements from left to right. All HTML elements can be visualized as boxes. The CSS box model describes the impact that CSS rules have on the styling of an HTML element. 

The CSS box model can be thought of as a series of nested boxes with the actual image or text content of the HTML tag as the innermost box. Progressing outward,  the spacing between the content and its border is called its padding. The border can be visible or invisible. The outermost box is called the margin which is the separation between an element and the elements above, below or on either side of it.
